# translation information

## character set

The bitmap graphics are generated from [gfx/fonts.png](gfx/fonts.png).

Each character is 8x8 pixels and normally includes whitespace to the right and
bottom.

[This site](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Character_encoding_in_Generation_I)
describes the conversion from bytes to characters. esperanto characters are
currently stored in 0xC0-0xDF.

Strings are written useing the
[X-system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto_orthography#X-system).
This is achieved by mapping sequences of characters in [charmap.asm](charmap.asm).
